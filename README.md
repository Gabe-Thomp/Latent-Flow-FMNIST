# Latent Flow Fashion-MNIST
 This was a small project that I did for a physics-informed neural networks class at NCSU. This main, final results are shown in the notebook `results.ipynb`. In the end, a model is trained that learns (approximate) equivariant transformations of Fashion-MNIST images, such as scaling, rotation, coloring.
 
NOTE: This idea and much of the code is from the paper Flow Factorized Representation Learning. The aim of this project was to replicate part of the paper with a similar dataset to get a feel for how much finaggling it would take to get it to run ourselves. Here is the [link to their paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13167) as well as a citation:
